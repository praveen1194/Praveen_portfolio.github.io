### Software engineer with over five years of experience in consulting, research and building scalable, practical solutions. My work spans software development, AI integration, and digital transformation — often in collaborative, cross-functional environments. I enjoy solving complex problems, learning new technologies, and contributing to projects that have a real-world impact. I'm currently focused on using my skills to help businesses innovate efficiently and sustainably.

## My Skillsets

- **Problem solving**: I approach problems with a clear definition of objectives and apply a hypothesis-led method to explore potential solutions. I actively seek out and practise structured problem-solving techniques to find more effective and creative outcomes.
- **Communication**: Working in a highly technical and client-facing role, I’ve developed the ability to adapt my communication style to suit both technical and non-technical audiences. I often draw on the EPIC model (Empathy, Purpose, Insight, Conversation) to structure my interactions with clarity and purpose.
- **Adaptability**: I use the APR (Awareness, Pause, Reframe) technique to stay grounded and flexible in the face of challenges. This mindset helps me recognise when to adjust my approach and continuously learn from changing environments.
- **Technical**: My work across different domains has given me exposure to a range of technologies, making it easier to pick up new tools and frameworks. This experience has improved both my technical versatility and my ability to adapt quickly when tackling unfamiliar systems.
- **Collaboration**: I’ve collaborated with clients, software development teams, and professionals from diverse domains such as automation, additive manufacturing, and business engagement. These cross-functional experiences have helped me build stronger working relationships and a more holistic understanding of project delivery and business development.
